            <h4>Dank Meme history</h4>
            <p>Dank memes have been around for a long time for the enjoyment of everyone. It could be an innocent meme that you would show your grandma or it could be a meme that you know you shouldn't be laughing at, but do anyway. Very loudly. Many people claim that memes came from 4chan but no one really knows where it all started. It just really means really radical, cool and neat.<em> That's one dank meme, Russell</em></p>
            <h4>Dank?</h4>
            <p>The word dank is actually 90's slang meaning awesome. But since not many people know this they think "dank memes" mean "bad memes". For example if you show someone a meme and they go "omg that's so dank" while having a face of unpleasantness then they are using the word dank wrong. At least it's not as bad other 90's slang like</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm all that and a bag of chips</li>
                <li>you're a wet sock</li>
                <li>You limp lettuce</li>

            <h4>Meme Royalty</h4>
            <p>One of the kings of memes is someone we all know. Harambe. Harambe sparked a whole set of memes when a child fell into the gorilla enclosure and harambe was shot for the child's "protection". His memes are still being used to this day.Harambe will be dearly missed. Harambe was not just a gorilla. "Heroes get remebered but legends never die".  </p>

            <p>Another meme king we would send to everyone was the Mr. Krabs blurry picture which was quickly replaced with the spongebob caveman picture. Sadly this happens all the time with new popular memes that are pulled from tv shows. There will always be a better and funnier picture to use in a meme. Do you feel it now Mr. Krabs? The sadness.</p>

            <p>The most recent meme king is the arthur meme. I have no clue how it started. I woke up one day and saw that everyone was sending me messages of arthur and I've never been more confused in my life. The Arthur meme is still sometimes being used although the more popular arthur meme is the fist Arthur makes. It's honestly one of the memes that I relate to the most.</p>

            <h4>Random Memes that don't make sense</h4>
            <p>Most memes make sense or are relatable in a way but some are purposefully outrageous and impossible so it's funnier because they act like everyone does the same thing. Or other times the meme is so dumb and dank at the same time that it's just funny. To laugh at memes is to have a great sense of humor because there will always be memes that should NOT be funny and there will be offensive memes out in the world. Sadly these types of memes can't be stopped and will always be created but once in a while you'll find yourself laughing at them. You horrible person.</p>
            <ul>
                <p>memes can be made from anything. Your favorite tv show, favorite movie, play, music video or even anime can be made into a meme. My favorite memes are the ones that are about school because it's very true. Now all I do in my spare time is send memes to my friends and then steal other peoples memes to use as my own. But sometimes these memes are too petty and I can't handle all the memes. Memes are just a great thing that happened. </p>
