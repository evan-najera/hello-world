			<h4>Dank Memes history</h4>
			<p>Memes have been around for so long for the enjoyment of everyone. It could be an innocent meme that you would show your grandma or it could be a meme that you know you shouldn't be laughing at but do anyway. Very loudly.</p>
			<h4>Modern Day Dank Memes</h4>
			<p>Anything can become a meme. You have an ugly crying face? Meme. You were caught lacking by friends? meme. No one is safe not even celebrities or the president.</p
